**PHP version 7.4.9**
Styled with *Materialize* CSS.


30 html tags across 4 templates and 3 web pages.
10+ PHP operators in the operators.php file.
All files linked together via...well, links.

Markup Validation Service sees errors only because it can't read PHP code and with that the require/include functions.
